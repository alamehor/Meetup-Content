####  [Meetup 2019](https://www.meetup.com/Entirety-ai-Intuition-to-Implementation/) Contents.

We will be discussing current trend in deep-learning and it's  surprisingly effective role in solving real case scenarios. This meetup  aims to educate, inspire, and enable you to rapidly prototype your next  idea using ML and DL models. The strategy will be to focus more on  Hands On experience first, and then, take you deeper into concepts.  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are evolving extremely fast  which makes the concepts invented last year, obsolete this year.  Therefore we will cover mostly the latest concepts used in the  industry. This meetup focuses on "how to build and understand", not just  "how to use".


### Who is the target audience?

Curious  about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning?  What's the difference between them? Want to understand how others are  using ML and DL creatively? If you are new to these areas or familiar  but curious and want to learn what is going on behind the scenes, then  this meetup is for you.All skill levels are welcome.

## Aim 
Make this repo a unified source for Deep learning.

Make education intutive and free for everyone.
